			<h1>Maze Extended</h1>
			<p>A couple years ago, when I was learning <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, I made a simple platformer engine. And since so many people liked my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/77278452/">Scratch Maze</a>, I decided to make an improved version: <b>Maze Extended</b>. Now with scrolling, <i>slightly</i> less boring music, and <i>wayyyy</i> more detailed instructions. Oh, and also a 3x larger map! To the point that beating it is, well, kind of tedious. You know what, just download it anyways.</p>
